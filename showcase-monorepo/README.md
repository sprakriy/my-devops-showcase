# ShowcaseMonorepo
Multi-Layered Cloud Infrastructure Platform
Orchestrated with Nx, Terraform, and GitHub Actions
🏗️ Executive Summary
In modern cloud environments, "Monolithic Terraform" (one massive state file) creates a massive "blast radius" and slow deployment times. This project demonstrates a Modular, Layered Infrastructure approach. By separating the foundational networking (Layer 1) from the service-specific DNS and Application logic (Layer 2), we achieve faster iterations and higher system stability.

💼 Business Problems Solved
1. The "Blast Radius" Risk
Problem: A minor change to a DNS record shouldn't risk deleting a production Database.

Solution: By decoupling the layers, we ensure that changes in the Service Layer cannot physically modify or destroy the Infrastructure Layer.

2. Ephemeral CI/CD Automation
Problem: GitHub Actions runners are "stateless" and forget everything once a job finishes.

Solution: Implemented a Persistent S3 Bridge that preserves Terraform Plan files across different workflow stages, ensuring that what is "Planned" is exactly what is "Applied."

3. Service Discovery & Security
Problem: Hardcoding IP addresses or long RDS endpoints is brittle and insecure.

Solution: Automated the creation of a Private Route53 Hosted Zone, allowing internal services to communicate via human-readable names (e.g., db.showcase.internal) that update automatically if the underlying hardware changes.

🛠️ Technical Architecture
Layer 1: The Foundation (infra-main)
VPC & Networking: Isolated private subnets.

Persistent Storage: AWS RDS (PostgreSQL) instance.

Exports: Securely shares the DB endpoint via Terraform Remote State.

Layer 2: The Services (infra-services)
DNS Management: AWS Route53 Private Zone.

Cross-Layer Dependency: Dynamically ingests Layer 1 outputs to create CNAME records.

Verification: Zero-trust verification via AWS CLI to ensure DNS records match the physical hardware.

🚀 The DevOps Pipeline
The project utilizes a custom Nx-powered workflow within GitHub Actions:

Monorepo Management: Nx detects exactly which layer changed and only runs the necessary plans.

State Management: State is stored in Amazon S3 with standardized naming conventions for easy auditing.

The "Plan-to-Apply" Handshake:

Plan generates a binary artifact.

Artifact is uploaded to S3.

Apply downloads that specific artifact, preventing "drift" during the deployment window.

📊 Operational Highlights
Cost Optimization: Automated "Destroy" sequences to ensure zero-waste cloud spending.

Auditability: Every change is verified against the AWS API directly, ensuring the "Source of Truth" in S3 matches the "Physical Reality" in the AWS Console

✨ Your new, shiny [Nx workspace](https://nx.dev) is ready ✨.

[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/getting-started/intro#learn-nx?utm_source=nx_project&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `npx nx graph` to visually explore what was created. Now, let's get you up to speed!

## Run tasks

To run tasks with Nx use:

```sh
npx nx <target> <project-name>
```

For example:

```sh
npx nx build myproject
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

To install a new plugin you can use the `nx add` command. Here's an example of adding the React plugin:
```sh
npx nx add @nx/react
```

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects. For example, to create a new React app or library:

```sh
# Generate an app
npx nx g @nx/react:app demo

# Generate a library
npx nx g @nx/react:lib some-lib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.

## Set up CI!

### Step 1

To connect to Nx Cloud, run the following command:

```sh
npx nx connect
```

Connecting to Nx Cloud ensures a [fast and scalable CI](https://nx.dev/ci/intro/why-nx-cloud?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) pipeline. It includes features such as:

- [Remote caching](https://nx.dev/ci/features/remote-cache?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/ci/features/distribute-task-execution?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Automated e2e test splitting](https://nx.dev/ci/features/split-e2e-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task flakiness detection and rerunning](https://nx.dev/ci/features/flaky-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

### Step 2

Use the following command to configure a CI workflow for your workspace:

```sh
npx nx g ci-workflow
```
